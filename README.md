# Blog Writing Automation with CrewAI üöÄ

Welcome to the **Blog Writing Automation** project! This project leverages the power of the CrewAI library and the LangChain Groq model to create high-quality, engaging blog posts based on user-provided topics, keywords, and audience specifications. Whether you're a seasoned blogger or just starting, our automated agents are here to help you craft content that's informative, authentic, and enjoyable to read.

## What's Inside? üì¶

- **Agents**: Meet our Topic Researcher and Blog Writer agents, each with a unique backstory and skill set. They're designed to work together to gather information and create compelling blog content.
- **Tasks**: From researching a topic to writing a complete blog post, our tasks ensure that each piece of content is well-researched, engaging, and tailored to your target audience.
- **Customization**: Provide your own topics, keywords, and audience details through a CSV file, and watch as our agents turn them into polished blog posts.

## How It Works üí°

1. **Setup Your Environment**: 
   - Make sure to have your environment variables set up. You can use a `.env` file to store sensitive information like API keys.

2. **Define Your Topics**:
   - Create a CSV file (`data/topics.csv`) with the columns: `topic`, `keywords`, and `audience`. This file will guide our agents on what to research and write about.

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Simply execute `main.py` to kick off the process. The script will:
     - Load environment variables.
     - Create the agents and tasks.
     - Process the CSV file to generate research and writing tasks.
     - Output the final blog posts into the `output` directory.

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blog-writing-automation.git
   cd blog-writing-automation
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed, then install the necessary packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Your .env File**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   ```

4. **Prepare Your Data**:
   Create a `data/topics.csv` file with the topics you want to explore.

5. **Run the Script**:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Example CSV Format üìÑ

Your `topics.csv` should look something like this:

| topic             | keywords                   | audience          |
|-------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| AI in Healthcare  | AI, healthcare, technology | Medical professionals, tech enthusiasts |
| Sustainable Living| sustainability, eco-friendly| Environmentally conscious individuals |

## Output üìÇ

The generated blog posts will be saved in the `output` directory. Each file will be named based on the topic, making it easy to find and review the content.
